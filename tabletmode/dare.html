            <!-- Didn't find an API, I guess they don't make "dare generator" APIs... Well, we're stuck with this. Anyway, this is just a demonstration - a working prototype - because the way this would work is that it would give you random dares from a database, and if you click 'I did the dare' it wouldn't give you the same dare again in that game, so essentially it would remove that particular dare from the database, temporarily of course. If you were to click 'I drank the cup' then it would leave the dare as it is, so the possibility of getting that dare again would remain.
            The functionality wasn't completed in this prototype due to lack of time (well, I wasted it trying to find an API for it, and it's 1:42AM ¯\_(ツ)_/¯)-->
